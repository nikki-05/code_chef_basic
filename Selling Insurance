Chef has started a new job as an insurance agent.
Each insurance costs X dollars and Chef gets a 20% commission on selling each insurance.
Find the minimum number of insurances Chef needs to sell to earn at least 100 dollars. 

The code in java would be like

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;

/* Name of the class has to be "Main" only if the class is public. */
class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.ArithmeticException
	{
		// your code goes here
		Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
		int T=sc.nextInt();
		while(T-->0){
		    int X=sc.nextInt();
		    double per= 0.2*X;
		    double min=100/per;
		    System.out.println((int)(Math.ceil(min)));   
		}
	}
}
