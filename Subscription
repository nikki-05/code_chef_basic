/*A new TV streaming service was recently started in Chefland called the Chef-TV.
A group of N friends in Chefland want to buy Chef-TV subscriptions. We know that 6 people can share one Chef-TV subscription. Also, the cost of one Chef-TV subscription is 
X rupees. Determine the minimum total cost that the group of N friends will incur so that everyone in the group is able to use Chef-TV.
Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers N and X — the size of the group of friends and the cost of one subscription.*/

the solution in java would be:
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;

class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		// your code goes here
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int t = sc.nextInt();
		while(t-->0){
		    int n = sc.nextInt();
		    int x = sc.nextInt();
		    int a = 0;
		    int c = n/6;   // to check the subscription
		    if(n % 6 != 0){
		        a++;
		    }
		    int ans=c+a;
		  System.out.println(ans*x);
		}

	}
}
