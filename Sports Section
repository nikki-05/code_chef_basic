The problem says The newspaper in Chefland consists of 10 pages numbered 1 to 10. The last 3 pages of the newspaper are always dedicated to the sports section.
Given a random page number X, determine whether that page is dedicated to the sports section.

The problem is simple and it uses a print function.
Since we are asked the last three pages therefore the loop goes from 7 onwards to 10 as while counting  8, 9, and 10  counts up to 3 and if the page lies between 8 to 10, we print YES otherwise we print NO

The solution in java:
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;
class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		//Your code goes here
		Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
		int X=sc.nextInt();
		if(X>7 && X<=10){           
		    System.out.println("YES");
		}
		else{
		    System.out.println("NO");
		}
	}
}
