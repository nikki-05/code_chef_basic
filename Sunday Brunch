On a sunny Sunday afternoon, Chef prepared a brunch for his 20 neighbours.Chef prepared a total of X plates. However, the meal was so good that the neighbours started taking Y plates each.
Find the maximum number of neighbours Chef can feed completely.
The question is simple and we are writing a solution in java:
solution: since chef prepared total of X plates so to find plates taken by each neighbour we would divide and if the answer would be greater than 20 it means chef can feed  all of the  neigbours
and if not then we would print those no. of plates.

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;

class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		// your code goes here
		Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
		int T=sc.nextInt();
		while(T-->0){
		    int X=sc.nextInt();
		    int Y=sc.nextInt();
		    int ans= X/Y;
		    if(ans<=20)
		        System.out.println(ans);
		    else
		        System.out.println(20);
		}
	}
}
